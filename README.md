# Blog


[Demo](https://blog-i0454ry34-serey-roth.vercel.app/)

I completed the Next.js tutorial and built a blog website. However, I wasn't satisfied with how it was looking so I decided to 
recreate it. This time, instead of storing the content as markdown files, I had the blog posts be stored on Contentful.

This is my second time working with a content management system (my first time was with Sanity). This project is also my exposure to
GraphQL web services.

## Next Steps
I want to include search capability for the posts, and I want to add an about page.
