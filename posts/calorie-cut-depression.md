There is some evidence to suggest that calorie restriction may worsen depression in some individuals. This may occur because calorie restriction can lead to an imbalance in certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, which are involved in mood regulation. In addition, calorie restriction can lead to physical and emotional changes that may contribute to feelings of depression, such as fatigue, low mood, and changes in body weight and appearance.  
<br />  

It is important to note that the relationship between calorie restriction and depression is complex and not fully understood. Different people may have different experiences with calorie restriction, and it is possible that calorie restriction may improve or worsen depression depending on the individual and their specific circumstances.  
<br />  

If you are considering calorie restriction as a means of improving your health and well-being, it is important to seek the guidance of a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian, to ensure that you are getting adequate nutrition and to address any potential negative effects on your mental health. It is also important to pay attention to your own feelings and experiences, and to seek support if you are struggling with depression or other mental health issues.

If you are currently struggling with depression, it is important to seek the support of a mental health professional and to consider treatment options that are safe and effective for you. This may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both. It is also important to prioritize self-care and to engage in activities that support your mental health, such as exercise, social support, and healthy coping strategies.
