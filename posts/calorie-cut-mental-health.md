Going on a calorie-restricted diet can potentially affect mental health in a number of ways. It is important to approach any diet or lifestyle change with caution and to consider how it may impact your overall well-being.      
<br />  

One potential effect of a calorie-restricted diet on mental health is an increase in stress and anxiety. This can occur because the body may perceive calorie restriction as a form of stress, leading to the release of stress hormones. In addition, the process of monitoring and tracking calorie intake can be mentally and emotionally taxing, especially if it becomes a source of stress or anxiety.      
<br />  

Another potential impact of a calorie-restricted diet on mental health is a decrease in mood and energy levels. This can occur because the body may not be getting enough fuel to function optimally, leading to feelings of fatigue and low mood.      
<br />  

It is also important to consider that calorie restriction may lead to an increase in negative thoughts and body image issues. This can occur if the diet becomes overly restrictive or if a person becomes overly focused on their weight or appearance.      
<br />  

Overall, it is important to approach any calorie-restricted diet with caution and to make sure that you are getting enough nutrients and fuel to support your physical and mental well-being. It is also important to seek the guidance of a healthcare professional, such as a registered dietitian, before starting any new diet or lifestyle change.
